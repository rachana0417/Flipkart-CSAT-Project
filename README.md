Flipkart CSAT Prediction Project
ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project is a Machine Learning Capstone based on Flipkartâ€™s customer support data. The goal is to predict Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT) using features such as item price, connected handling time, and service channels.

The workflow includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

Model Building (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)

Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1)

Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)

Feature Importance Analysis

Saving & Loading Model (for deployment readiness)

ðŸ”¹ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Flipkart-CSAT-Project.git


Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab / VS Code.

Run cells in order (EDA â†’ ML â†’ Save & Load model).

The best-performing model (Random Forest) will be saved as best_model.pkl.

Load the saved model and test with unseen data for predictions.

ðŸ”¹ Results

Random Forest Classifier achieved higher accuracy than Logistic Regression.

Feature importance analysis showed connected_handling_time and channel_name as major contributors to CSAT.

Final model is saved and ready for deployment.
